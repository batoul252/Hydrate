# ðŸ’¦Hydrate

Hydrate is an app designed to make daily water tracking simple and enjoyable, helping users stay on top of their hydration goals. With a sleek, user-friendly design built in SwiftUI, Hydrate offers intuitive features that make tracking and managing water intake easy.

## Features

1. **Getting Started**: Begin by entering your body weight on the appâ€™s setup page. Hydrate will calculate an ideal daily water intake based on your weight, creating a personalized hydration goal.




2. **Setting Reminders**: Hydrate makes it easy to set custom reminders to drink water at specific times, helping you maintain consistent hydration throughout the day.



3. **Tracking Progress**: The main screen displays your current water intake alongside the daily goal. A dynamic circular progress bar updates in real time, so you can visually see your progress throughout the day.
   - **Fun Progress Icons**: Motivational icons change as you progress. If you havenâ€™t started, a sleeping icon will appear. As you begin logging intake, a tortoise represents initial progress, a hare shows faster progress, and clapping hands celebrate when you achieve your goal.




4. **Adjusting Water Intake**: Log your water intake using intuitive plus and minus buttons, allowing you to easily update your progress.

Hydrate empowers you to stay consistent with your hydration habits, making water tracking both effortless and rewarding. Whether you're aiming to improve your health or simply ensure steady hydration, Hydrate is your reliable daily companion.
