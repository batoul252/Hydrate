I developed an app called Hydrate to help users easily track their daily water intake and stay 
motivated to reach their hydration goals. The app uses a simple and engaging design built with SwiftUI, focusing on user experience. 

The main screen displays the current water intake alongside a daily goal, and a dynamic circular progress bar visually represents the progress. To make the experience more fun,
I added icons that change based on progress: for example, a sleeping icon if the goal hasnâ€™t started, a tortoise for initial progress, a hare for faster progress,
and clapping hands to celebrate when the goal is achieved.

Users can add or subtract from their intake using intuitive plus and minus buttons. The app also makes it easy to set personalized hydration goals, making it a convenient tool for anyone 
looking to maintain their daily water intake consistently.
